            <p className="text">I have a neighbor that has an art studio so I go over and take <br/> my time and think what am I going to paint.

Words grouped into an army of lyrics that create a voice in a crowd of millions. <br/> <br/>~ Ivan </p>

            <p className="text"> Breaking the Sentence <br/> <br/> Why imprison yourself in the past when you have a future? <br/> Why dwell in the memories of long ago <br/> That should be learned from and buried in the distant graveyard <br/> What do you gain? <br/> But a sentence of eternal suffering <br/> Why let those painful memories shape who you are <br/> When you can move forward in life? <br/><br/>~ Jocelyn  </p>
