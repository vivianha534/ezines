            <h2 className="subTitle">The Very Hungry Kitchen</h2>
            <p className="text"> Pusheen the cat is hungry. She lives in a house with her owner, Alex. And Pusheen needs to find food because her owner is running short on money. So Pusheen sneaks outside to go to the neighbors to beg for food by being really cute. How does a cat be cute? She makes cute eyes. And purrs. It’s a trick Pusheen does. And of course it works! She gets cat food. She does it again at random houses. It would seem suspicious if she went back to the same people. And she comes home very happy.<br/><br/>~ Rigo</p>
            <p className="text"> I want to be wise and lovable and respectful. I want to change the Earth. <br/> <br/> ~ Damian </p>
            <p className="text"> A Seed is Planted <br/> <br/> A seed is planted, <br/> As it waits to  <br/> Sprout from its rich <br/> Soil, when it prepares itself to live and <br/> Survive this world, <br/> The first days of its bloom <br/> Are its innocence <br/> Something priceless, but as <br/> Its days of life <br/> Come, they are bound, to end <br/> That one pure part of itself <br/> Is torn apart by <br/> this cruel <br/> World then and only then <br/> Does that sweet and innocent being <br/> Perish, hoping to <br/> One day be what  <br/> It once was and <br/> Make a change for  <br/> The better <br/> <br/> ~ Jeanette </p>
            <p className="text">I am From <br/> <br/> I am from a place where if you’re black or Latino, you’re more likely to go to jail than college. <br/> I am from a place where an average income in a household is 20,000 dollars or less. <br/> I am from a place where five percent of the people have a four-year college degree. <br/> I am from a place where there are 3,889 families headed by single parents.  The rate is twenty one percent, which is high for the city of Los Angeles. <br/> I am from a place where I might lose a female friend due to teenage pregnancy. <br/> I am from a place where the LAUSD has the second worst graduation rate in the country. <br/> But I am also from a place where the people hustle harder than anybody else. <br/> I am from a place where people like the same things. <br/> I am from a place where people like chips better than a five-star meal. <br/> I am from Boyle Heights. <br/> <br/> ~ Jose </p>
            <p className="text">Awaken! <br/> <br/> Fresh out of the womb <br/> yet full of potential <br/> I was crowned in crimson. <br/><br/> Throughout life, <br/> this skin  <br/> has been all shades  <br/> of brown <br/> <br/> However, <br/> my hair has always been  <br/> a sleek <br/> dark river. <br/> Weaved with resilience and ancestral knowledge. <br/> <br/> My mouth <br/> holds a tongue <br/> with a mind  <br/> of its own <br/> <br/> She is unapologetic and untamed. <br/> <br/> ~Regina </p>
            <p className="text"> Beautiful Frijolitos <br/> <br/> “Frijolitos” is how my eighth grade English teacher referred to us, <br/> At first, not knowing it was only hurting us. <br/> She would often say it as a joke <br/> But you can see the menace in her look. <br/> She knew what she was doing but didn’t try to stop <br/> Instead she told herself we were inferior just ‘cause she was on top. <br/> We’d end up selling oranges she’d say <br/> But hey! <br/> Just because we’re brown doesn’t mean we need to frown. <br/> What she didn’t know was we wear a crown everywhere we go. <br/> Embrace your roots <br/> Don’t let oppression get to you! <br/> We might be muy “chiquitos” now <br/> But we will be beautiful “frijolitos” forever <br/> <br/> ~ Alicia </p>
